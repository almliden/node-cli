# Node CLI

Skeleton for building CLI-tools in node.

## Run

Make file executable: `chmod +x command`

Execute file: `./command`

For POSIX systems to make it avaible to run from anywhere for the current user there are some options:

- Add the folder to `$PATH`
- Create a reference in `/usr/local/bin/` (or similar). Either by copying the file to that directory, or have a reference to where this project is located.
